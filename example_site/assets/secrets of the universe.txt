(Ba Ba - etc.)
I'm a Nut, I'm a Nut,
My life don't ever get in a rut
Well Hell, my shoulders are sore and loose
That I ain't got the sense God gave a goose
Now Lord I ain't crazy but, I'm a nut

Is it wetter underwater if you're there when it rains
Is it shorter to New York, than it is by plane
Between myself and I, I wonder who's the dumber
Is it hotter down south than it is in the Summer
Bee ba ba de bop etc.

I'm a Nut, I'm a Nut,
My life don't ever get in a rut (ba ba di di etc)
Well Hell, my shoulders are sore and loose
That I ain't got the sense God gave a goose
Now Lord I ain't crazy but, I'm a nut

I drove my Cadillac to Vegas to satisfy my lust
Wheelin', Dealin', left old Vegas on a Greyhound Bus
I sure didn't set the woods on fire while I was there
But remember only forest fires breath in fires (be ba be da diddly etc.)

[Interlude:]

I'm a Nut, I'm a Nut,
My life don't ever get in a rut (ba ba di di etc)
Well Hell, my shoulders are sore and loose
That I ain't got the sense God gave a goose
Now Lord I ain't crazy but, I'm a nut

The poverty war will be over, when I begin to fight
If it took a dime to go around the world, I couldn't get out of sight
I don't mind to take the girls out, if they don't mind to go Dutch
When you feel like a million dollars, and I bet I ain't worth half that much(ba ba di di etc)

I'm a Nut, I'm a Nut,
My life don't ever get in a rut (ba ba di di etc)
Well Hell, my shoulders are sore and loose
That I ain't got the sense God gave a goose
Now Lord I ain't crazy but, I'm a nut

Oh crazy man, I'm a nut, crazy man... Fade
